# odin-recipes

this is a project from the odin project that is designed to help me practice my skills with HTML boilerplate and webpage design.

I will also practice using git commands from the command line to clean up my workflow.

This website will be ugly and brutalist and it will display a number of different recipes with images and the procedure for cooking these recipes.
